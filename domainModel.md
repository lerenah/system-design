A domain model is a conceptual representation of the core business logic and rules of an application. It reflects the real-world entities, relationships, and operations relevant to the domain being modeled. The primary purpose of a domain model is to ensure that the software accurately represents the business requirements and processes.

### Key Components of a Domain Model

1. **Entities**:
   - **Definition**: Objects that have a distinct identity and lifecycle.
   - **Examples**: Customer, Order, Product.
   - **Characteristics**: Each entity is uniquely identifiable (e.g., by an ID).

2. **Value Objects**:
   - **Definition**: Objects that describe aspects of the domain with no distinct identity.
   - **Examples**: Address, Money, Date Range.
   - **Characteristics**: Value objects are immutable and compared based on their properties.

3. **Aggregates**:
   - **Definition**: Clusters of entities and value objects that are treated as a single unit for data changes.
   - **Examples**: An Order aggregate might include Order entities and Order Line value objects.
   - **Characteristics**: Each aggregate has a root entity (aggregate root) that controls access to the aggregate.

4. **Repositories**:
   - **Definition**: Mechanisms for retrieving and storing aggregates.
   - **Examples**: OrderRepository, CustomerRepository.
   - **Characteristics**: Encapsulate the logic for accessing data sources and hide the complexities of data retrieval.

5. **Services**:
   - **Definition**: Operations that don't naturally fit within entities or value objects but are part of the domain logic.
   - **Examples**: PaymentProcessingService, NotificationService.
   - **Characteristics**: Often stateless and perform business operations.

6. **Domain Events**:
   - **Definition**: Represent significant events or changes in the domain.
   - **Examples**: OrderPlaced, PaymentReceived.
   - **Characteristics**: Used to trigger side effects and communicate between different parts of the domain.

### Example of a Domain Model

Let's take an e-commerce application as an example. The core domain involves managing orders, products, and customers.

#### Entities

```python
class Customer:
    def __init__(self, customer_id, name, email):
        self.customer_id = customer_id
        self.name = name
        self.email = email

class Product:
    def __init__(self, product_id, name, price):
        self.product_id = product_id
        self.name = name
        self.price = price

class Order:
    def __init__(self, order_id, customer, order_lines):
        self.order_id = order_id
        self.customer = customer
        self.order_lines = order_lines
        self.completed = False

    def complete_order(self):
        self.completed = True
```

#### Value Objects

```python
class Address:
    def __init__(self, street, city, zip_code):
        self.street = street
        self.city = city
        self.zip_code = zip_code

class OrderLine:
    def __init__(self, product, quantity):
        self.product = product
        self.quantity = quantity

    @property
    def total_price(self):
        return self.product.price * self.quantity
```

#### Aggregates

```python
class OrderAggregate:
    def __init__(self, order):
        self.order = order

    def add_order_line(self, product, quantity):
        order_line = OrderLine(product, quantity)
        self.order.order_lines.append(order_line)

    def remove_order_line(self, product_id):
        self.order.order_lines = [line for line in self.order.order_lines if line.product.product_id != product_id]
```

#### Repositories

```python
class OrderRepository:
    def __init__(self):
        self.orders = {}

    def save(self, order):
        self.orders[order.order_id] = order

    def find_by_id(self, order_id):
        return self.orders.get(order_id)
```

#### Services

```python
class PaymentProcessingService:
    def process_payment(self, order, payment_details):
        # Implement payment processing logic
        pass
```

#### Domain Events

```python
class OrderPlaced:
    def __init__(self, order):
        self.order = order

class PaymentReceived:
    def __init__(self, order, amount):
        self.order = order
        self.amount = amount
```

### Benefits of a Domain Model

1. **Alignment with Business Logic**: Ensures the software accurately reflects the business requirements and processes.
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
3. **Flexibility**: Well-defined domain models can adapt to changing business requirements with minimal impact on other parts of the system.
4. **Reusability**: Components of the domain model can be reused across different parts of the application or even in different applications.

The **Domain Layer** can be split into the **Service Layer** and the **Domain Model**:
  
- **Service Layer**: Acts as an intermediary between the application's user interface (or controllers) and the Domain Model. The Service Layer coordinates tasks, enforces business rules, and handles transactions, but it delegates the actual business logic to the Domain Model.

### Example Scenario: An E-commerce System

Let's consider an e-commerce system where customers can place orders. We'll demonstrate how the Domain Layer can be split into the Domain Model and the Service Layer.

#### 1. **Domain Model**

The Domain Model represents the business entities and contains the core business logic. Below are examples of the `Order` and `Product` classes in the Domain Model.

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class Product:
    def __init__(self, product_id, name, price, stock):
        self.product_id = product_id
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
        self.stock = stock

    def reduce_stock(self, quantity):
        if self.stock < quantity:
            raise ValueError("Not enough stock available")
        self.stock -= quantity

    def is_in_stock(self, quantity):
        return self.stock >= quantity

class Order:
    def __init__(self, order_id, customer, order_date=None):
        self.order_id = order_id
        self.customer = customer
        self.order_date = order_date or datetime.now()
        self.items = []

    def add_item(self, product, quantity):
        if not product.is_in_stock(quantity):
            raise ValueError("Product out of stock")
        self.items.append((product, quantity))
        product.reduce_stock(quantity)

    def get_total_price(self):
        return sum(item[0].price * item[1] for item in self.items)
```

- **`Product`**: Encapsulates product-related logic like checking stock and reducing stock when an order is placed.
- **`Order`**: Manages the list of ordered items, checks stock availability, and calculates the total price.

#### 2. **Service Layer**

The Service Layer is responsible for orchestrating actions that involve multiple domain objects or require business processes. It provides methods that the application (such as a web controller) calls.

```python
class OrderService:
    def __init__(self, order_repository, product_repository):
        self.order_repository = order_repository
        self.product_repository = product_repository

    def place_order(self, customer, product_quantities):
        order = Order(order_id=self.order_repository.next_id(), customer=customer)

        for product_id, quantity in product_quantities.items():
            product = self.product_repository.find_by_id(product_id)
            order.add_item(product, quantity)
        
        self.order_repository.save(order)
        return order

    def calculate_order_total(self, order_id):
        order = self.order_repository.find_by_id(order_id)
        if not order:
            raise ValueError("Order not found")
        return order.get_total_price()
```

- **`OrderService`**: Provides a higher-level interface for placing an order (`place_order`) and calculating the total price of an order (`calculate_order_total`). It interacts with the Domain Model (`Order` and `Product`) and repositories to persist data and enforce business rules.
- **Repositories**: Handle the persistence of domain objects (e.g., saving and retrieving orders and products from a database). These are often part of the infrastructure but are used by the Service Layer to manage data access.

#### How the Split Works:

- **Domain Model**: Contains the business entities (`Product`, `Order`) and their logic. This layer is responsible for ensuring that the business rules are followed, such as not allowing an order to be placed if there isn’t enough stock.

- **Service Layer**: Acts as a façade or a higher-level API that the application can use to interact with the Domain Model. It handles more complex processes that might involve multiple domain objects, such as placing an order, calculating totals, and managing transactions.

### Benefits of This Split:

- **Separation of Concerns**: The Domain Model focuses on business rules and data, while the Service Layer handles application-specific processes and interactions between different parts of the domain.

- **Reusability**: Business logic is encapsulated in the Domain Model, making it reusable across different parts of the application or even different applications.

- **Testability**: The Domain Model can be tested independently of the Service Layer. Similarly, the Service Layer can be tested to ensure it correctly coordinates tasks without needing to worry about the lower-level business rules.

By splitting the Domain Layer into a **Domain Model** and a **Service Layer**, you create a clear separation between the core business logic and the orchestration logic that coordinates domain objects and processes. The Domain Model focuses on the behavior and state of individual entities, while the Service Layer provides a higher-level interface for application use cases, making the architecture more modular, maintainable, and scalable.
