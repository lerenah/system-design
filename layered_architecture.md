### Path for Diving into Layered Architecture:

1. **Introduction to Layered Architecture (Book)**:
   - **Read the Introduction**: Understand the context and importance of architectural patterns.
   - **Layered Architecture (Chapter 1)**: Read this chapter thoroughly to grasp the basic principles and structure of a layered architecture.

2. **Supplement with Online Articles**:
   - **"Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture: Layered Architecture"**: This is Martin Fowler's online summary that complements the book.
   - **"Microservices"**: Understand how layered architecture can be applied or adapted in a microservices context.
   - **"Frontend Integration for Microservices"**: Learn how to effectively integrate the frontend layer with microservices.

3. **Deep Dive into Specific Layers (Book)**:
   - **Presentation Layer**: Focus on patterns related to the presentation layer, such as MVC (Model-View-Controller) and MVP (Model-View-Presenter). While these are detailed in later chapters, the understanding from the Layered Architecture chapter will be foundational.
   - **Business Logic Layer**: Study the patterns related to domain logic, such as Transaction Script and Domain Model, which are essential for the service layer in a layered architecture.
   - **Data Source Layer**: Explore patterns like Data Mapper, Active Record, and Gateway, which help manage data persistence and interactions with the database.

4. **Related Patterns and Practices (Book)**:
   - **Service Layer (Chapter 8)**: This chapter elaborates on how to structure the service layer in a layered architecture.
   - **Distribution Strategies (Chapter 7)**: Understand how to manage distributed components within a layered architecture.

5. **Advanced Topics and Modern Practices (Online)**:
   - **"Microservice Trade-Offs"**: Dive into the trade-offs when applying layered architecture principles in microservices.
   - **"Continuous Integration" and "Continuous Delivery"**: Learn how these practices support maintaining and evolving a layered architecture.
   - **"Refactoring"**: Understand how to refactor a layered architecture to maintain its integrity and adapt to new requirements.

6. **Case Studies and Examples (Online and Book)**:
   - **"Isomorphic JavaScript"**: See how modern JavaScript frameworks, like React, fit into the presentation layer of a layered architecture.
   - **"Event-Driven Architecture"**: Explore how event-driven patterns can complement a layered architecture, especially in complex systems.
